In the Front-End Engineering program we begin by building skills in HTML, CSS, and Design Fundamentals. We continue by laying a solid foundation in core JavaScript, then progress into React. In the final quarter, students build backend applications with Node and SQL. In total, FEE graduates have the skills to turn design comps into working applications.'\n\t          )\n\t        ),\n\t        _react2.default.createElement(\n\t          'article',\n\t          { className: 'experience-card' },\n\t          _react2.default.createElement(\n\t            'h4',\n\t            null,\n\t            'Ciris Energy Inc.   - Centennial, CO'\n\t          ),\n\t          _react2.default.createElement(\n\t            'h6',\n\t            null,\n\t            'MARCH 2014 - DECEMBER 2016'\n\t          ),\n\t          _react2.default.createElement(\n\t            'p',\n\t            null,\n\t            'Responsibly transforming carbon-based resources through the integration of science and engineering.

When I came across the UFO Sightings API in an internet thread, I read a few claims and knew I found my data set which proved to be much larger then I could have imagined. I am always thinking of new functionality the user may want when diving into the wild world of UFO sightings. Next steps are to learn/add a form of data visualization (ie. chart.js, d3.js, victory.js) that can provide the user with data trends.
